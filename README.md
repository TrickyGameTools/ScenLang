# ScenLang

This is a simple tool I use myself to do the dual language scenarios for my RPG games.
Older versions of this tool were used to write the scenario for Star Story and The Fairy Tale REVAMPED, and this version is being used for 63 Fires of Lung.

It can be used to write scenarios in any number of languages, and if you don't like its native storage format, you can export the data to JSON, Lua, Python and XML.

In order to create a project you will need the [ScenLang Creation Tool](https://github.com/TrickyGameTools/ScenLang_Create) to quickly set up a template. The "file suffixed with ".scenlangproject.gini" can then be loaded in the file selector. Each language will come with its own .jcr file in which the scenarios themselves are stored (packed with the lzma compression algorithm).


# Compilation note

The girl displayed in the releases is Seelah Gandra a.k.a. Scyndi Scorpio. That character, the name and picture are property of Jeroen P. Broks and may not be freely distributed in modified versions of this tool. That is why she's not included in this repository. If you add any file named "mascot.png" in the "mascot" folder, you can compile anyway. Read the readme.md file in the mascot folder for more details.
Further stuff you should know if you want to compile this program from source can be found in the build folder.
